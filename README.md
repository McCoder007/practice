# ESL Vocabulary & Practice App

A Next.js web app for ESL students: vocabulary, prepositions, verb tenses, irregular verbs, and more. Deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

The app lives in the `vocabulary-next/` directory:

```bash
cd vocabulary-next
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). For API keys (Firebase, TTS) and app-specific docs, see [vocabulary-next/README.md](vocabulary-next/README.md).

## Deploy

Pushes to `main` trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that builds `vocabulary-next` and deploys to GitHub Pages. No root-level files are used by the deploy.

## Legacy / archive

The previous vanilla JS app and related data and docs have been moved to [archive/](archive/) for reference. See [archive/README.md](archive/README.md) for contents and restoration notes.
